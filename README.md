# blood_donation_app
Our application Donatorr was developed using Flutter framework, on android studio. We employed Firebase for the backend. The user authentication and data storage have been integrated with the aforementioned. The user information consists of daily health stats and blood type. In the blood donor page, we get the list of available donors and their compatible medical info. For the local medicine reminder we utilized the local database.
